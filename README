liveblog is an application for real time writing and comments.  The goal is to allow users to see your writing or story being written as you write it, and allow them to comment as you write.

This is largely a side project to learn node.js, socket.io, the express framework, jade and haml, and couchdb, and this project is far from secure and far from complete.
